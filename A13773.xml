            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> may remember, that in the verball conference, he denied vnto me, that it was commanded in Scripture, not to miniſter Circumciſion, but on the eight day, which here he confeſſeth. He alledged in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Iewiſh Traditions, that Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe did approoue them, finding good that the Iewes ſhould admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Circumciſion on the Sabbath day, which by the ſcripture they might not do, which commandeth that no work ſhould be doon in the ſame, ſo that it muſt needs be, that this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſpenſation was giuen them by Tradition. To which <hi>I</hi> anſwered, ſeeing the commandement was expreſſe in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to circumciſe euery male child the eight day, which might as well fall on the Sabbath day as on any other, they were therefore grounded on the ſcripture; Conſidering alſo that God in the commaundement, forbade onely our works, not his; amongſt which, is the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He replied vnto me, that theſe words (<hi>octauo die,</hi> the eight day) did not preciſely ſignifie the eight day: but within the eight day, and would neuer let go this gloſe, though <hi>I</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

                        <p>The conſequence that he draweth, that women ſhould not be baptized, if the correſpondency of circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were ſuch as we wold haue it, is a meer cauill. For ſeeing that Circumciſion did ſhew forth the ſanctification of the Jſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits ſeed, the females that were borne of this ſeed were as well ſanctified as the males, who alone were capable of the external ſign of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; al the analogy of faith &amp; the neceſſary conſequence of Scripture teacheth vs, that we muſt admit women to the communion of the Euchariſt: ſo doth it teach vs alſo, that they muſt be baptized, ſeing they are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this Sacrament as the males.</p>

                        <p>Seing Baptisme bringeth the ſame ſpirituall fruit to the children of Chriſtians, that Circumciſion brought to the children of the Iews, as hath bene ſhewed; this conſideration of a corporall mark is friuolous.

                     <p>The third argument is taken from the Actes, where Saint Peter ſaith, that hauing ſeene the holy Ghost come down on them that heard the word in the houſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he could not deny them Baptiſme, ſeeing they had receiued the ſame grace: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they conclude, thoſe that are capable of the ſame grace, are capable of the ſame ſigne. Now little children are capable of the ſame grace: they are therefore capable of the ſame ſign. To which without standing to reply, that in the olld Teſtament weomen are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2143:17"/> capable of the ſame grace, and not of the ſame ſigne, We may anſwer for the Anabaptists, that thoſe which are capable of the ſame grace, and in the ſame manner or faſhion are capable of the ſame ſigne: But thoſe that are capable of the ſame grace in diuers manners, are not therefore for all that capable of the ſame ſigne. Now little children (will the Anabaptiſts ſay) are capable indeed of the ſame grace, as thoſe that bee of age, but not in the ſame manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for thoſe of age are capable of grace, by theyr owne perſonall faith, and little children by their parents faith, which is imputed vnto them. And therfore to the former is requiſite a Baptiſm proper and perſonall, and to the others ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the imputatiue Baptiſme of their parents, it being a thing reaſonable, that Baptiſme do follow the quality of faith, whereof it is a Sacrament. And this anſwer ſerueth for all argumentes of like nature, namely, that little children are parte of the Church, are capable of the kingdome of heauen, whereof bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the gate and entrance. For after the ſame manner as they are capable of it, that is to ſay, no otherwiſe then by an imputed faith and not perſonall, Baptiſme (would they ſay) is communicated vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that as they beleeue in the faith of their parents, vntill they bee capable of a perſonall faith: ſo are they Baptized in the Baptiſme of their parentes, till they bee baptized with a perſonall Baptiſme; namely, when they are come to yeares of diſcretion and knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To theſe three reaſons they adde a little light coniecture of that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that he baptized the houſhoulde of <hi>Stephan:</hi> out of which they conclude, that little children may he baptized. Which argument is lame on both ſides: For firſt they muſt proue that there were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children in the houſhold of <hi>Stephan,</hi> which the ſcripture dooth not ſhew: and ſecondly, that thoſe litle children were particularly baptized For although there had bin little children in that hous yet this witnes of S. <hi>Paul</hi> of hauing baptized the houſhold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,</hi> could for al that conclude nothing for them, vnles there had bin expreſſe mention made, that they were particularly baptized.

                        <p>The ſame ſpeculation which his anſwers conteineth, if they were of any weight, might haue had place as well againſt the Circumciſion of little children; and ſeeing that the different meaſure of grace did not depriue them of the ſigne, in like manner ours ought not to be depriued of it. The Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">11.12</note> that the Gentiles, becauſe they were not receiued into the couenant of Circumciſion, were without Chriſt, without hope, without God, and ſtrangers from the Couenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The ſame Scripture ſheweth vs, that Baptiſm hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Circumciſion: Shall we then repute our children for ſtraungers from the couenaunts of promiſe? Shall we holld them only for children of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, for children of wrath, ſubiect to the curſe, for fleſh and blood, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſeſſe the kingdom of heauen, without bringing them to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom they are ſanctified and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? If by faith imputed, the B. of <hi>Eureux,</hi> meaneth a quality
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2143:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> without and foorth of children; and if he ſay, that they pleaſe God, the Holy Ghoſt not making any reall change in them, He deſtroyeth theſe principles of Scripture, which ſay:<note place="margin">Reuel.</note> That none vncleane thing entreth into heauen,<note place="margin">Rom. 1</note> That the iuſt ſhall liue by his own faith, That none hath acceſſe to the kingdom of heauen, vnles he be regenerate, That without faith it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God. Now faith and vnbeliefe are things immediatly contrary: not that we would ſay, that children do beleeue after the ſame manner, as they that be of years, with an actuall knowledge: but that the Holy Ghoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in them an inclination and power to belieue, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their hart, that which naturally repugneth. VVhen <hi>ſaint Augustin</hi> ſaith, that children are baptized in the faith of others, as either of their parents, or of them that preſent them, or of the whole Church, he excludeth not all operation of the Holy Ghoſt in the perſon of children, which in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he plainly confeſſeth to be in them: As when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep ad Dar</note> We ſay that the holy ghoſt dwelleth in litle children which are baptized, though they know him not: For in that they doo not know him, it is no otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they knovv not their reaſonable ſoule, yea their life. Whereof notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it doth not folow, that they haue neither reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule nor life. This operation is as eaſy to god, as to vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible: And the hart of an ould man, before he be chaunged by regeneration, is no leſſe deaffe and vnable, than the hart of a child, the chaunge whereof is not none, becauſe it is vnknown: likewiſe the diſobedience and rebellion, which is in them that be of years, is a diſpoſition contrary to faith, which is not in litle ones, who receiue oftentimes greater meaſure of grace, than they that be of years, vvho notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, after our Aduerſaries themſelues, are not vncapable of the externall ſign, though they ask it but of hypoctiſy.

                     <p>And to conclude in a word this point, either they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, are heretickes. For it is an article of faith, that there is one Baptiſme, one Faith, as ſaith ſaint <hi>Paul:</hi> and the ſymbole of the Church ſaith, I beleeue one baptiſm for remiſſion of ſins. Now if Baptiſme of little children be not true Baptiſme, thoſe which bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, haue no Baptiſme, and therefore are heretickes, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating this article of ſaith, I beleeue one Baptiſme. And if it bee true Baptiſm, the Anabaptiſts are hereticks, who rebaptize them. For they redouble Baptiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt that article of faith: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue one Baptiſme. It being then neceſſary that one of the two ſides be hereticall, and it not being posſible by the ſcripture alone to verifie which of the two it is: it followeth that all hereſie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confuted by the Scripture alone. Out of which I frame this Syllogiſme. Whatſoeuer conteineth ſufficientlie the principles of a ſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould alſo be able to prooue all the propoſitions pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſaid ſcience, and to confute all that repugn the ſame. Now euery hereſie repugneth the ſcience of diuinitie and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the ſcripture alone cannot confute all hereſies. Therfore the ſcripture containeth not ſufficiently, all the principles of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine neceſſary to the ſcience of diuinity and religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt employ therein other principles conioyntly with the ſcriptures, which cannot haue authority in this caſe, if they bee not reuealed by the word of God. It muſt therefore bee graunted, that beſides the word of god written, ther is yet another part of the ſame word not written, among which alſo ſaint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> againſt this hereſie concerning the Baptiſme of little children, ſaith: <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The ſecond hereſy, which cannot be refuted by the Scripture, is that of the Rebaptizing of hereticks. For there is no one place in the writings of the Prophets or Apoſtles, that witneſſeth, that the Baptiſme which is among hereticks, is true Baptiſme. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe there are infinite places which ſeeme to repugne the ſame: As the words of our Lord, hee which ſhall beleeue and bee baptized. &amp;c, And that of ſainte Paule, one faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: whereof is concluded, that ſeeing there is no fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong hereticks, and that this vnity of fayth of which Saint Paule ſpeaketh, is not found among them, there is no Baptiſme. So that they which haue beene Baptiſed by them, are no more baptiſed, then thoſe on whoſe head by chance ſome water is caſt, ſeeing they want the chiefe and principall condition, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man be a matter and ſubiect capable of Baptiſme, namely Fayth: That they that are Baptized, as ſaith Saint Paule, haue put on Chriſt, That Chriſt cannot bee put on out of the Church, which is called the fullnes of Chriſt &amp; that therfore Baptiſme cannot be among hereticks: That euery one of you ſayth Saint Peter, be Baptized for remiſſion of ſinnes, And the Creed of Conſtantinople: I beleeue one Baptiſme for remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of ſinnes. Now among the haereticks there is no remiſſion of ſinnes: For the Keyes were giuen to the Church; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent no Baptiſme, that when it was tolde Iohn Baptist, that Chriſt Baptized, he anſwered, none can doe it vnles it be giuen him from heauen: that no authority is giuen from heauen to the aſſemblies of hereticks, and therefore that they cannot Baptize.

                     <p>As touching the forme, we obſerue not Sundayes the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of the weeke, but as the firſt: ſo that though it bee ſtill an obſeruation of one day of the ſeauen, yet neuertheleſſe it is no more an obſeruation of the ſeuenth but of the firſt of the ſeauen: contrary to that which was obſerued in the ould law, And therfore the Fathers of the Primitiue Church reckoned as well, as we doe now, Wedneſday, and Friday for the fourth &amp; ſixt feriae or daies of Ceſſation, beginning at Sonday for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their ſupputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: So that inſtituting Sunday, it is not a changing of Saturday into Sunday, but the bringing in of a new ſolemne feaſt, which hath no conformity with feaſt of the Sabbaoth. Alſo we ſee that in the primitiue Church, wherein they would yet bury the Synagogue with ſome honour: for to ſhew that they would not ſubstitute Sonday in ſaturdays roome, but inſtitute ſunday a new, as the particuler feaſt of Christians they obſerued them both at once, ſaturday in commemoration of the precepte of Moſes, &amp; ſunday for to celebrate the particular feaſt of Chriſts reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For God marked and poynted them out a day, at which be would haue them begin to reckon and account their ſeptenary reuolution, which was that ſame (as is moſt probable) which repreſented by the order of the reuolution thereof, the day of Gods reſt, after the Creation of the world, for a commemoration where of it was ordayned: And for this cauſe he that propounded vnto them for to beginne the ſolemnization of the ſabbath, ſent them twice ſo much Manna as the dayes before, &amp; commaunded them to gather of it double as much, that ſo the next day which ſhould be the ſabbath; they might be free and vacant from all corporall labour. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this abſolute ſuppreſſion of the ſabbath, in which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2143:27"/> the end, the forme and the matter of the commaundement are aboliſhed, and this new bringing in of ſunday, is not grounded vpon any written ordinance, neither of Christ nor his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: Contrariwiſe it ſeeemeth that our Lord exhorting them to pray that there flight might not be on the ſabbath day, when the deſolation foretold of by Daniell ſhould come to paſſe: It is thought his intent was, that the ſabbath ſhould still be obſerued of Christians, after the ſuppreſſion of the other legall ceremonyes For as for that which is written in the Apocalyps that S.

                  <p>He accuſeth me of two frauds. 1. In that I ſummon the aduerſaries to proue by the ſcripture all the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betweene vs and them, not onely ſuch as be of the Eſſence of our ſaluation, but others alſo leſſe important: and in the meane while reſtraine the diſputation of things neceſſarie, when it is ſhewed that the Apoſtles left certaine things to their diſciples, without writing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. That in ſtead of prouing the points in queſtion, by ſuch cleare and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible texts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that euerie ſimple Iſraelite, might haue framed of it a neceſſarie &amp; indubitable conſequence, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce onely ſome probable and coniecturall apparances or ſhewes. To the firſt obiection I anſwere: that wee neuer change our <hi>Theſis.</hi> Wee proue by the ſcripture the points, that we beleeue neceſſarie to ſaluation: and wee demaund of our aduerſaries, the like proofe for the points, that they pretend to be ſuch, whether of neceſsitie abſolute or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall. Wee reiect many things of the Romiſh Church, which at firſt ſight ſeeme not to oppugne ſaluation, but their conſequences daſh againſt it. For example: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to eate fleſh on certaine daies, is in it ſelfe a light thing, and may be practiſed for certaine politicke reſpectes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14</note> which concerne not our ſaluation, ſith that the kingdome of God is neither meat nor drinke. But to make of it a law for to binde the conſcience, to declare the tranſgreſſion thereof, a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: to conſtitute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in merite towards God, to attribute vnto it an expiatorie power to doe away ſinnes,<note place="margin">C. violato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, it is falſe, that we conclude ſo, as the Biſhop of <hi>Eureux</hi> ſaith we doe: <hi>That is not in the Scripture, it is therefore an impietie and ſuperſtition.</hi> Our concluſions are thus: That is not in the ſcripture, and notwithſtanding is commaunded vs to be kept, as neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, by him who hath no authoritie to make lawes to the conſcience: Therefore it is an impietie, or ſuperſtition. Wee grant alſo, that ſome things touching the order &amp; outward policy of the Church, things not vnmooueable and vnchangeable, as is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith; haue not beene written: neither all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler deeds and ſayings of our Sauiour, and his Apoſtles: But it is one thing to ſay, All the heades of doctrine are not written; and another thing to ſay, All the particularities compriſed vnder euerie head or kinde are not written: We ſay that the Apoſtles haue written all the heads of doctrine: <hi>genera ſinguloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> though not all the particularities of euerie head; <hi>Non ſingula generum.</hi> For as it is impoſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them all, ſo is it not poſſible to write them all. And for this cauſe we neuer denied, but that there were things vnwritten vnder both Teſtaments; &amp; as we doe not meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and flatly reiect them, ſo we receiue them not all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcretion or difference; Neither hold we them that we receiue, in the ſame degree of authoritie with the ſcripture: becauſe the Apoſtles themſelues, inaſmuch as they haue not inregiſtred them with the reſt, haue weakened their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and manifeſted, that they were not things abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſarie, &amp; that the doctrine that may be drawne from them, is ſufficiently declared in the things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which are neuer ſo particuler, but that wee may draw thence inſtruction, for the generall Rule of fayth;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2143:42"/> And the number of theſe ſame, is ſo ample in their writings, that to Chriſtians they ſuffice, whether it be to learne the truth, or to reprooue errour. This is that which is principally regarded in matter of Teſtaments, namely what is written, and not what the Teſtator ſaid by word of mouth to any one, who may varie or forget; which is not to bee feared in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when the Apoſtles make mention in their writings of ſome particular thing, holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; receiued among the Iews, though not expreſſed in the writings of the Old Teſtament: it followeth not, either that they would authoriſe all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Phariſes, or that they eſteemed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture imperfect, or that they ſet thoſe vnwritten particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they alledge, in the ſame degree of neceſſitie or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as they doe the things written; For if of ſuch alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations one would inferre equall authoritie with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would follow that the poems of <hi>Aratus, Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Epimenides,</hi> out of whom ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> citeth ſome verſes, ſhould be equall to the ſcripture,<note place="margin">Acts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Biſhopp of Eureux findeth, that this is but an hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall threatning, for to terrifie men from manſlaughter. But they which take the prohibitions of Murder for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles; they are the very ſame that hyperbolically giue licence to themſelues to commit it, following the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of the Apoſtles, (vnleſſe it be of Iudas;) but of certaine Robbers among the Donatiſts, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Circumcelliones.</p>

                     <p>From the taking vp of <hi>Henoch,</hi> I make this argument: he which is taken out of this life, &amp; gathered vnto god enioyeth an eternall felicity: But <hi>Henoch</hi> being no more ſeene among men, was gathered or taken away vnto GOD: therefore,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2143:71"/> 
                        <hi>Henoch</hi> enioyeth eternall felicitie. This argument proueth not only the immortalitie of the ſoule; But alſo Paradiſe, that is to ſay, an eternall felicitie. The Sadduces reply, by the mouth of his aduocate <hi>Du Perron,</hi> is: <hi>That it may bee graunted that this tranſlation was a withdrawing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of men, and a delay and ſtaying of death, till a certaine time, vnknowne to men of the firſt ages, but that it followeth not that the ſoule, after the extinction of the bodie ſubſiſteth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwere, that if it be permitted to the Saducie, and his Aduocate, to adde to the text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> what they pleaſe, they may conclude from thence what they liſt, and one day ſhall finde, that which they will like but little. But this <hi>Sadducean</hi> or <hi>Perronian</hi> gloſſe, is contrarie to the Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſetteth downe vnto vs the temporall life of <hi>Henoch,</hi> much ſhorter than was the ordinarie of that time: So that this taking vp, cannot be vnderſtood of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, or ſtaying of death. Moreouer, this text repreſenteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs <hi>Henoch,</hi> as the moſt excellent man in pietie and loue of GOD, which liued in his age; and ſetteth forth vnto vs alſo, without the helpe of any gloſſe, his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, as a manifeſt teſtimonie of the fauour of God towards him.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, all the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs; that it was rather the teſtimonie of a curſe, than of a bleſſing to be ſoone depriued of this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, ſeeing that long life vpon earth is promiſed &amp; propounded as a ſpeciall bleſſing: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From the Couenant, that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> I argue thus:<note place="margin">Geneſ, 15.17, 2, 4.7.</note> A couenant that dureth for euer, requireth that the parties betweene whom it is contracted, doe abide for euer: But the couenaunt that GOD contracteth with his, dureth for euer: Therefore they muſt alſo abide for euer. The onely light of nature ſheweth, as well to the Iewes, and to the Heathen; as to Chriſtians, the truth of the Maior: For it is moſt certein, that when one of the Correlatiues is extinct, the relation which is betweene them is extinct alſo: The Minor is prooued to a Sadducie by a good number of places of <hi>Moſes,</hi> alleadged in my former aunſwere, which the Biſhoppe of <hi>Eureux</hi> calleth a Rhapſodie of coniectures; a name more fit for the matter in queſtion than hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, or intendeth, if wee take it in the ſenſe, that <hi>Euſtathius Homers</hi> interpreter teacheth vs; that is to ſay, for a Lawrell Rod, where triumphant Trueth abateth the impudencie of a blaſphemer, who maketh the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grounded on the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to ſay, on Ieſus Chriſt, common to brute beaſtes; vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that GOD promiſed to <hi>Noah,</hi> not to drowne the earth any more, by a Deluge:<note place="margin">Fol. 11</note> ſo that euen beaſts taſt of this fauour, not periſhing any more all at once, as they did in the Deluge. To an Hebrewe Sadducie, one may ſhew him by his own tongue, that the word <hi>(Berith)</hi> commonly tranſlated, couenant, is taken ſometimes generally, for euerie declaration, whether of counſaile, of commaundement, or of promiſe: As wee ſee by the examples. <hi>Leui.</hi> 24.8. <hi>Nomb.</hi> 18.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.12: In which places, this word ſignifyeth nothing elſe but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, like as it is taken in this place in queſtion, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9.11. Sometimes it is particularly vnderſtood, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and couenant made betweene parties, which doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally or mutually condition and accept: Now that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2143:73"/> the couenant made betweene GOD and <hi>Abraham,</hi> is ſuch a one; is ſhewed by the ſeuenteeth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where wee ſee GOD on the one ſide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioning; and on the other ſide, <hi>Abraham</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Du Perron</hi> will make his inſtance of any force, hee muſt ſhew the like conditioning and acceptation betweene God, and beaſtes; Or elſe let him confeſſe, that this word (couenant) agreeth not in the ſame ſenſe, or vniuocally, to men and to beaſtes. In the ſame Chapter 7. verſe. God hauing ſaid, that this couenant betweene him and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is perpetuall; ſheweth in what it conſiſteth, to wit, in that hee is the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, eyther that <hi>Abraham</hi> is permanent for euer, or that the couenant is not perpetuall or permanent. For how could God bee the God of one which is not? And this conſequence was found ſo neceſſarie in the argument of Ieſus Chriſt againſt the Sadducies, that they knewe not what to replie thereunto, though they knewe the place of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 9.11. as well as their Aduocate <hi>Du Perron.</hi>

Let vs ſet him downe the argument in this ſort: Whoſoeuer hath God for reward, hath more than an earthly and temporall thing: But <hi>Abraham</hi> hath God for reward, therefore hee hath more than an earthly and temporall thing.

                     <p>Bellarmine himſelfe ſaith: <hi>our Lord being about to prooue the Reſurrection to the Saduces, alleadged this teſtimony of Scripture, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaak and the God of Iacob: and addeth, God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing; whence his intention is to inferre: The dead therefore riſe againe.</hi> Now although the Saduces denyed alſo the Immortality of the ſoule; yet the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, ſeemed vnto them much more abſurde; And vpon this pointe was grounded the moſt formall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, betweene them and the Phariſes, as appeareth, by that which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <p>But our Biſhopp attributeth this opinion to Chriſt, for to conforme it with that of one of his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vicars, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. who was conſtrayned by a King of France, to retract it, and to vnſay himſelfe by ſound of Trumpet, as

                     <p>From the bleſſing of the Prieſt, that aſſured the Iſraelits of the keeping &amp; peace of God; I reaſon thus: They whom God keepeth cannot periſh, God keepeth them that be his, therefore they cannot periſh. Or elſe in this forme: They that periſh are not kept of God; the people of God are kept of God, therefore they cannot periſh. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they ſhould periſh if death deſtroyed them, and wholly brought them to nothing.

It followeth that the peace and mercie of God taketh away this puniſhment, &amp; conſequenly cauſeth that death cannot hurt, at leaſtwiſe them, that are partakers of this peace and mercie of God, according as is conteyned in the bleſſing: Otherwiſe the effectes of the wrath, and mercie of God, ſhould bee both alike; and his fauour and peace ſhould not reſtore the felicitie loſt by the tranſgreſsion of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now the Sadducie ſeeth well, that this is not effected alwaies, nor yet ordinarily in this life, which is fuller of calamities to the children of God, than to others: Therefore there muſt bee another life, wherein this accompliſhment is found.</p>

                     <p>From the ſixth Chapter, 24. verſe, I conclude thus: If they that feare the Lord, haue promiſe to be euer preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aliue; It muſt follow that there is an Eternall life: Now the Antecedent is conteined in theſe words of <hi>Moſes, The Lord hath commaunded to doe all theſe ordinances, and to feare the Lord our God, that it may goe euer well with vs, and that hee may preſerue vs aliue, as at this preſent.</hi> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>From the 14. chapter, firſt verſe, is framed this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: children haue part in their fathers inheritance: <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth the Iſraelites the children of the Lord: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue part in his inheritance.

                     <p>From the 30. chapter, 15. and 16 verſes, where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before the Iſraelites life and death; bleſſing and curſing, I reaſon thus: if the life and bleſsing, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, bee but temporall and not eternall: God himſelfe is not Eternall: The conſequent is horrible blaſphemie: Therefore the antecedent is neceſſarily falſe. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is prooued by the twentieth verſe following of the ſame Chapter, in which God is called the life and length of daies of that people; whence I conclude: he that hath the Lord for life, and for length of his daies; ſhall liue for euer: but the faithfull, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> haue the Lord for their life: therefore they ſhall liue for euer.

                        </gap>ter, one may eate the fiſh part, that is to ſay of a creature halfe bleſſed &amp; halfe curſed. Such myſteries indeed would neuer be drawne from the onely litterall text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if Tradition did not le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d helpe thereunto: But the conſequence that it draweth from the curſe of the earth, for to forbid fleſh meates is ſo glittering and ſparkling bright, that it dazelleth the eyes that are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but to the light of the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>For if it be not lawfull to eat fleſh, becauſe the earth is curſed in the workes of man; we muſt by neceſſarie and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſequence conclude, either that in like ſorte bread ſhould not be eaten: or that in the time, when this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, men plowed and ſowed in the ſea and corne grew there, that they might eate of it, as partaker of the bleſſing giuen to fiſhes, which is a Tradition, that hath neede of another ſubſidiarie Tradition, to helpe to vnderſtand it.</p>
                     <p>From the .31. chapter, 16. verſe, where God ſaith to <hi>Moſes</hi> that he ſhall ſleepe with his fathers: is gathered the ſame argument, that aboue is produced out of diuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2143:84"/> of Geneſis: yea there may two be gathered, whereof this word (Sleepe) doth furniſh vs the firſt: for to ſleepe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth ſome Being. And that which is aboliſhed, is not capable of ſleepe: One cannot ſay that he which is not yet borne ſleepeth: No more can one ſay therefore, with <hi>Plynie</hi> and the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that after man is deade, it is the ſame thing, as before he was borne or conceiued. The other argument is taken from this whole ſpeach, <hi>to ſleepe with his Fathers:</hi> Thoſe Fathers therefore muſt haue ſome Beeing: or elſe let the Biſhoppe of <hi>Eureux</hi> teach vs what difference there is betweene ſleeping all alone, and ſleeping with ſome that haue no being at all.</p>
                     <p>From the 32. Chapter, 9. verſe, I conclude thus: The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Lord is vncorruptible: Iſraell, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> is the Lords poſſeſſion, therefore it is vncorruptible.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame Chapter, 10, verſe; He that is kept of God as the apple of his eye, cannot be wholly deſtroyed Iſraell was ſo kept: Therefore &amp;c. The Biſhops cauillation vpon this argument, is aboue refuted.</p>

The ſame gloſe reporteth the opinion of ſome others, which held, that this ſerpent tooke the pleaſant countenance of a mayden; and condemneth it for no other reaſon, but becauſe the ſcripture doth not authoriſe it, Now that theſe effectes, namely, ſpeech, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue diſcourſe, ſoliciting the woman to diſobedience, did exceede the naturall facultie of a naturall Serpent: there is no Sadducee can denie: therefore this facultie came to it, eyther of man, or of God, or from ſome other ſpirit, that hath it in it ſelfe: This cannot bee of man; for man cannot giue ſpeach, reaſon, and diſcourſe to a beaſt; beſides there was then but two humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who had not any knowledge at all of it. Neyther was it GOD, that ſpeake to the woman by the Serpents mouth: for that were to accuſe him of too deteſtable a fraude and malice, as did the wretched Ophites: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it was not a good Angell: For <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth vnto vs, in many places, that Angels doe keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue men from euill: And this fact heere as <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth it, ſheweth, that it was an enemie of men: not a faithfull ſeruant of GOD, that vndertooke it, and whoſe calumnie or falſe accuſation, wee ſee in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Text, verie clearely, whence hee is called deuill, that is to ſay, calumniator or falſe accuſer, hauing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God falſely vnto men as enuious of their good and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute felicitie: and this hiſtorie cannot ſeeme abſurde, no not to a Heathen, who readeth in prophane hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that horſes, bulles, trees, ſtatues, or images, and riuers, haue ſpoken; which wee reiect not as ſimply and

Let vs ſe the Logicke of our Carneades. <hi>The ſonnes of</hi> Sceua <hi>after the death of Chriſt, were not true Exorciſts: Ergo before Chriſts death
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2143:97"/> there was an order of the true Exorciſts, grounded on diuine right:</hi> See how from a negation he draweth an affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if we receiue the expoſition of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> which he ſhould accept of, as a ſubſidiary Tradition: This Inſtance taken from the order of Exorciſts, ſhall be yet more ridiculous; for he preſuppoſeth as a thing confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaking of Exorciſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely his Apoſtles and diſciples;<note place="margin">Fol. 81.</note> which (ſaith he) <hi>had already driuen out Diuells, by the power they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their Maiſter, the Phariſes not hauing blamed them for it: For their malice was but to the perſon, not to the thing: Therefore that he might ſhew, that what they ſaid or thought againſt him, proceeded but of meere enuie; he told them of the Apoſtles.</hi>

                     <p>The other appeareth by analogie or proportion of the Law, which ſaith.

Wherefore you that feare the Lord, praiſe him in the places where you are: For change of places, maketh not the Lord neerer; but God wil come to thee, ſo that the houſe of thy ſoule be found ſuch, that he may dwell in thee. If thy inward man be full of peruerſe thoughts, though thou beeſt at Golgotha, at the mount of Oliues, or vnder the ſepulchre of the reſurrection; yet thou ſhalt receiue Ieſus Chriſt as little into thee, as they that neuer made profeſſion of Religion.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2143:116"/> his booke of the Reuelation, for a ſhutting vp of the new Teſtament. The other fraud is to diſpute, in what ſenſe this propoſition is ſufficient, or not: as if neither Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor all the other Writers of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had written any thing elſe but theſe words only: <hi>Ieſus is that Christ, that Sonne of God,</hi> without adding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other proofe or explication, without any other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, or doctrine whatſoeuer: a fraude moſt neceſſarie for his deſperate Cauſe, giuing him occaſion in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to heape vp a great number of wordes to fill vp paper, or rather duſt to caſt into mens eyes. If ſo many things, as the Euangeliſts doe write, conteine not the meanes for to proue this propoſition, and for to ſhewe plainly what Chriſt is; to wit, his two natures, and his three Offices; to what vſe ſerue they then? how can a thing ſo vnſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in it ſelfe, make vs haue eternal life? If they containe but a part of the meanes and neceſſarie proofes, what reaſon was there, to ſet downe onely that part and to omit the principall? What reaſon was there, to make ſo many bookes, and to fill them with matters, which (to ſet foorth our Biſhops opinion in one word,) ſerueth to no vſe at all, ſeeing that euen that which is written cannot be vnderſtood, without his ſubſidiarie Tradition? could any more ſhamefully defame the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Euangeliſts? theſe Notaries and Secretaries of the holy Ghoſt, than in accuſing them ſo manifeſtly of diſloyaltie in their charge, of hauing ſuppreſſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed eſſentiall and principall clauſes in this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they haue framed and left, for to ſerue for the perpetual canon or rule to the chriſtian Church?

For the Pope now a daies attributeth as much, yea much more power and authoritie to himſelfe, than they, did that were ſeauen or eight hundred yeares agoe; and requireth no leſſe, but much more obedience, in that which at this day he commaundeth, than in that which his predeceſſours commaunded a thouſand yeares ago: For as before the God of heauen, a thouſand yeares are as one day; ſo before this God on earth, one day is as a thouſand years, when there is queſtion to make himſelf be obeyed: Yea, the time hath been, when Popes thought they could not well eſtabliſh their owne lawes, vnleſſe they did aboliſh the lawes of their predeceſſors: that is, vnleſſe they diſplanted Antiquitie to plant in noueltie.
